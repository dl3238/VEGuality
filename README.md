# MSTU 5013 Final Project: VEGuality  

### By: Melissa Yeo, Brenda Khor, Dongxin Li

#### Design Summary
* Strategy
    * <b>Problem</b>: We talked to vegans, and wanted to see what common problems they faced, and what could be done if they had a website. While a lot of them talked about lack of food options, another theme was that they felt alone, and that they had no support.
    * <b>User needs</b>: vegan related resources in 1 location. Many current websites currently tend to be more siloed e.g., information about restaurants and shops, articles related to vegan issues, events sites. Consequently, it is hard for a vegan person to access the information they want in a single site which is frustrating.
    * <b>Goal</b>: To build a one-stop portal where vegans can access resources (e.g., information about food substitutes, vegan fashion) as well as find out more about community events and in general find ways to establish themselves more firmly into the vegan community if so desired.    
    * <b>Target Audience</b>: vegans and people who want to find out more about the movement
* Scope
    * Inline with the information surfaced through our interviews, we decided that the following would be our navbar tabs and related content
        * Switch - Why veganism, what's veganism etc
        * Cook - Recipes (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
        * Explore - what you can eat at restaurants if vegan, fashion, friendly cities, follow the movement events
        * Inspire - Video (inspire others to eat with care), how to talk to others, motivating media
            * Stories arranged by time stamp
        * Laugh - Jokes, pick up lines, answers for silly questions that people ask
            * Posts arranged by time stamp
        * Own feed - contain grocery list, my story, my posts (e.g., tips, laughs)
